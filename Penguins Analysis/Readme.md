# Penguin Size Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes penguin size data using a dataset containing attributes like species, island, culmen measurements, flipper length, body mass, and sex. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, species characteristics, and factors affecting penguin size.

## Dataset
- **Source**: The dataset includes information on penguins collected from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago.
- **Columns**:
  - `species`: Penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo).
  - `island`: Observation island (Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream).
  - `culmen_length_mm`: Length of the bill in millimeters.
  - `culmen_depth_mm`: Depth of the bill in millimeters.
  - `flipper_length_mm`: Length of the flipper in millimeters.
  - `body_mass_g`: Body mass in grams.
  - `sex`: Gender of the penguin.

## Analysis
Key insights derived from the data include:
1. **Species Characteristics**: Each species exhibits unique size attributes (e.g., culmen size, body mass).
2. **Island Variations**: Size differences among penguins across islands suggest environmental influences.
3. **Sexual Dimorphism**: Male and female penguins show distinct size differences.
4. **Size Correlations**: Relationships among body mass, flipper length, and culmen dimensions highlight adaptations.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For visualization and interactive analysis.
- **Python**: For data preprocessing and statistical calculations.
  
## Future Improvements
- Incorporate machine learning to predict species based on size attributes.
- Add geographical and environmental factors for deeper insights.
